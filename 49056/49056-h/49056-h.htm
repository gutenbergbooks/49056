Marines in the Recapture of Guam</h2>

<p class="in0" style="margin-bottom: 2em;"><i>by Cyril J. O’Brien</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">With</span> the instantaneous
opening of a two-hour,
ever-increasing
bombardment by six
battleships, nine cruisers,
a host of destroyers and rocket
ships, laying their wrath on the wrinkled
black hills, rice paddies, cliffs,
and caves that faced the attacking
fleet on the west side of the island,
Liberation Day for Guam began at
0530, 21 July 1944.</p>

<p>Fourteen-inch guns belching fire
and thunder set spectacular blossoms
of flame sprouting on the fields and
hillsides inland. It was all very plain
to see in the glow of star shells which
illuminated the shore, the ships, and
the troops who lined the rails of the
transports and LSTs (Landing Ships,
Tank) which brought the U.S. Marines
and soldiers there.</p>

<p>The barrages, which at daylight
would be enlarged by the strafing
and bombing of carrier fighters,
bombers, and torpedo planes, were
the grand climax of 13 days (since 8
July) of unceasing prelanding
softening-up. Indeed, carrier aircraft
of Task Force 58 had been blasting
Guam airfields since 11 June, while
the first bombardment of the B-24s
and B-25s of the Fifth, Seventh, and
Thirteenth Air Forces fell as early as
6 May.</p>

<p>Up at 0230 to a by-now traditional
Marine prelanding breakfast of steak
and eggs, the assault troops, laden
with fighting gear, sheathed bayonets
protruding from their packs, hurried
and waited, while the loudspeakers
shouted “Now hear this.... Now
hear this.” Unit commanders on
board the LSTs visited each of their
men, checking gear, straightening
packs, rendering an encouraging pat
on a shoulder, and squaring away the
queues going below to the well decks
before boarding the LVTs (Landing
Vehicles, Tracked).</p>

<p>Troops on the APAs (attack transports)
went over the rail and down
cargo nets to which they&mdash;weighed
down with 40-pound packs as well
as weapons&mdash;held on for dear life,
and into LCVPs (Landing Craft, Vehicle
and Personnel). These troops
would transfer from the landing craft
to LVTs at the reef’s edge, if all went
as planned.</p>

<p>Aircraft went roaring in over mast
tops and naval guns produced a continuous
booming background noise.
Climaxing it all was the voice of
Major General Roy S. Geiger, commanding
general of III Amphibious
Corps, rasping from a bulkhead
speaker:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You have been honored. The
eyes of the nation watch you as
you go into battle to liberate this
former American bastion from
the enemy. The honor which
has been bestowed on you is a
signal one. May the glorious
traditions of the Marine Corps’
esprit de corps spur you to victory.
You have been honored.</p></blockquote>

  <img src="images/i_001.jpg" width="312" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><i>SOUTHERN MARIANAS</i></div></div>

<p>In the crowded, stifling well decks
of the LSTs, the liberators climbed on
board the LVTs and waited claustrophobic
until the LST bow doors
dropped and the tracked landing vehicles
rattled out over these ramps
into the swell of the sea. As the amphibian
tractors circled (about 0615)
near the line of departure, a flight of
attack aircraft from the <i>Wasp</i>
drowned out the whine of the amtrac
engines and whirled up clouds
of fire and dust, obscuring the landing
beaches ahead. Eighty-five fighters,
65 bombers, and 53 torpedo
planes executed a grass-cutting strafing
and bombing sweep along all of
the landing beaches from above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
northern beaches of Agana, south
for 14 miles to Bangi Point.</p>

<p>“My aim is to get the troops ashore
standing up,” said Rear Admiral
Richard L. Conolly, Southern Attack
Force (Task Force 53) commander,
who earned the nickname “Close-in
Conolly” during the Marshalls operations
for his insistence on having his
naval gunfire support ships firing
from stations very close to the
beaches.</p>

<p>Private First Class James G. Helt, a
radioman with Headquarters and
Service Company, 1st Battalion, 3d
Marines, in the bow of an LVT moving
towards shore, wondered, as did
many others, if anything could
still be alive on Guam? Ashore, Lieutenant
Colonel Hideyuki Takeda, on
the staff of the defending <i>29th Division</i>,
said the island could only be
defended if the Americans did not
land. In a diary, one Japanese officer
noted that the only respite from the
bombardment was a “stiff drink.”</p>

<p>The next best thing to a welcome
mat for Marine assault waves had
been laid by the audacious Navy Underwater
Demolition Teams 3, 4, and
6, who cleared the beach obstacles.
Navy Chief Petty Officer James R.
Chittum of Team 3 noted that these
pathfinders were usually close
enough to draw small arms fire. At
Asan, they exploded 640 wire obstacle
cages filled with cemented coral,
and at Agat they blew a 200-foot
hole for unloading in the coral reef.
Team 3, under Navy Reserve Lieutenant
Thomas C. Crist, also removed
half of a small freighter from
a channel blocking the way of the
Marines.</p>

<p>Swimmers as well as scouts, the
“demos” reconnoitered right up on the
landing beaches themselves. They
left a sign for the first assault wave
at Asan: “Welcome Marines&mdash;USO
This Way.”</p>

<p>At 0730 a flare was shot in the air
above the waiting flotilla and Admiral
Conolly commanded: “Land
the Landing Force.” At 0808, the first
wave of the 3d Marine Division
broke the circle of waiting LVTs to
form a line and cross the 2,000 yards
of water to the 2,500-yard-wide
beach between Asan and Adelup
points. At 0829, the first elements of
the 3d Marine Division were on
Guam. Three minutes later, 0832,
lead assault troops of the 1st Provisional
Marine Brigade crossed the
shelled-pocked strand at Agat, six
miles south of the Asan-Adelup
beachhead.</p>

<p class="drop-cap tancap"><span class="smcap1">Major</span> General Roy S. Geiger,
as the other general officers
in the Guam invasion force,
was a World War I veteran. He also was
an early Marine Corps aviator. He was
the fifth Marine to become a naval
aviator&mdash;in 1917&mdash;and the 49th in the
naval service to obtain his wings. He
went to France in July of that year and
commanded a squadron of the First Marine
Aviation Force. In the war and after,
he saw service with Marine Corps air
units. He also was well educated professionally,
for he attended the Army Command
and General Staff School at Fort
Leavenworth in 1924&ndash;1925 and was a student
in the Senior and Advanced
Courses at the Naval War College, Newport,
Rhode Island, 1939&ndash;1941. In August
1941, he became commanding
general of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing
and led it at Guadalcanal during the
difficult days from September to November
1942. Back in Washington in 1943,
he was Director of Aviation, until, on
the untimely death of Major General
Charles D. Barnett, Commanding
General, I Marine Amphibious Corps,
just prior to the Bougainville landings,
General Geiger was rushed out to the Pacific
to assume command and direct the
landings at Empress Augusta Bay on 1
November 1943. He was the first Marine
aviator to head as large a ground command
as IMAC, which was redesignated
III Amphibious Corps in April 1944.
He led this organization in the liberation
of Guam in July 1944, and in the landings
on Peleliu on 15 September 1944.
General Geiger led this corps into action
for the fourth time as part of the Tenth
Army in the invasion of Okinawa. Upon
the death of Army Lieutenant General
Simon B. Buckner, Geiger took command
of the Tenth Army, the first Marine
to lead an army-sized force. In July
1945, at the end of the Okinawa operation,
General Geiger assumed command
of Fleet Marine Force, Pacific, at Pearl
Harbor. In November 1946 he returned
to Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps, in
Washington, and died the following
year. By an act of Congress, he was
posthumously promoted to the rank of
general.

Treaty of Paris in 1899, ending the
Spanish-American War. Earlier, on
21 June 1898, First Lieutenant John
Twiggs “Handsome Jack” Myers had
led a party of Marines ashore from
the protected cruiser <i>Charleston</i> to
accept the surrender of the Spanish
authorities, who didn’t know that a
state of war then existed between
Spain and the United States. Thus began
a long Marine presence on
Guam. The island, southernmost of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
the Marianas chain, was discovered
by Ferdinand Magellan in 1521, but
not occupied until 1688 when a small
mission was established there by a
Spanish priest and soldiers. When
control of the rest of the Mariana Islands,
including Saipan and Tinian,
all once German possessions, was
given to Japan as a mandate power
in 1919, Guam became an isolated
and highly vulnerable American outpost
in a Japanese sea.</p>

<p>This American territory, 35 miles
long, nine miles at its widest and four
at its narrowest, shaped like a
peanut, with a year-long mean temperature
of 79 degrees, fell quickly
and easily in the early morning of 10
December 1941. Much of the Japanese
attack on Guam came from her
sister island of Saipan, 150 miles to
the north.</p>

<p>The governor of Guam, Captain
George J. McMillan (the island
governor was always a U.S. Navy
officer), aware that he could expect
no reinforcement or relief, decided to
surrender the territory to Japanese
naval forces. Foremost in his mind
was the fate of the 20,000 Guamanians,
all American nationals, who
would inevitably suffer if a strong
defense was mounted. He felt “the situation
was simply hopeless.” He sent
word to the 153 Marines of the barracks
detachment at Sumay on Orote
Peninsula and the 80-man Insular
Guard to lay down their arms. Even
so, in two days of bombing and fighting,
the garrison lost 19 men killed
and 42 wounded, including four Marines
killed and 12 wounded.</p>

<h2><a name="Operation_Forager" id="Operation_Forager"></a><i>Operation Forager</i></h2>

<p>In late 1943, both the Joint Chiefs
of Staff (JCS) and, later, the Combined
Chiefs of Staff (CCS) agreed to
the further direction of the Pacific
War. General Douglas MacArthur,
commander of the Southwest Pacific
Area, was to head north through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
New Guinea to regain the Philippines.
Admiral Chester W. Nimitz,
Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific
Fleet, and Pacific Ocean Areas
(CinCPac/CinCPOA), proposed a
move through the Central Pacific to
secure a hold in the Marianas. The
strategic bombing of Japan would
originate from captured fields on
Guam, Saipan, and Tinian. The new
strategic weapon for these attacks
would be the B-29 bomber, which
had a range of 3,000 miles while carrying
10,000 pounds of bombs. The
code name of the Marianas operation
was “Forager.” The Central Pacific
drive began with the landing on
Tarawa in November 1943, followed
by the landings in Kwajalein Atoll on
Roi-Namur, Eniwetok, and
Kwajalein itself.</p>

<p>In January 1944, Admiral Nimitz
made final plans for Guam, and
selected his command structure for
the Marianas campaign. Accordingly,
Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, the
victor at Midway, was designated
commander of the Fifth Fleet and of
all the Central Pacific Task Forces; he
would command all units involved in
Forager.</p>

<p>Vice Admiral Richmond K. Turner,
who had commanded naval forces
for the landings at Guadalcanal and
Tarawa, headed the Joint Expeditionary
Force (Task Force 51). Turner
would also command the Northern
Attack Force for the invasion of Saipan
and Tinian. Admiral Conolly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
who had commanded the invasion
forces at Roi and Namur in the Marshalls,
would head the Southern Attack
Force (Task Force 53) assigned
to Guam. Marine Major General
(later Lieutenant General) Holland
M. Smith, the Expeditionary Troops
commander for the Marianas, would
be responsible for the Northern
Troops and Landing Force at Saipan
and Tinian, essentially the Marine V
Amphibious Corps (VAC). Major
General Roy S. Geiger, an aviator
who had conducted the Bougainville
operation, was to command the
Southern Troops and Landing Force,
the III Amphibious Corps, at Guam.</p>

<p>D-Day for the invasion of Saipan
had been set for 15 June. It was an
important date also for the 3d Marine
Division, commanded by Major
General Allen H. “Hal” Turnage; the
1st Provisional Marine Brigade under
Brigadier General Lemuel C.
Shepherd, Jr.; and the Army’s 77th
Infantry Division under Major
General Andrew D. Bruce. They were
to land on Guam on 18 June, but the
3d Division and the brigade first
would wait as floating reserve until
the course of operations on Saipan
became clear. The 77th would stand
by on Oahu, ready to be called forward
when needed.</p>

<p>Admiral Spruance kept the floating
reserve well south and east of Saipan,
out of the path of an expected
Japanese naval attack. A powerful
Japanese fleet, eager to close with the
American invasion force, descended
upon the Marianas. The opposing
carrier groups clashed nearby in the
Battle of the Philippine Sea, one of
the major air battles of the war. The
Imperial Navy lost 330 out of the 430
planes it launched in the fray. The
clash (19 June), called “the Great
Marianas Turkey Shoot,” was catastrophic
for the Japanese and ended
once and for all any naval or air
threat to the Marianas invasion.</p>

<p>With the hard fighting on Saipan
turning gradually but inevitably in
favor of the American Marines and
soldiers battling the Japanese, the
U.S. Navy was ready to direct its attention
to Guam, which was now
slated to receive the most thorough
pre-landing bombardment yet seen in
the Pacific War. After weeks at sea,
the 3d Division and the 1st Brigade
were given a respite and a chance to
go ashore to lose their “sea legs” after
so long a period on board ships.
The Task Force 53 convoy moved
back to Eniwetok Atoll, whose huge
20-mile-wide lagoon was rapidly becoming
a major forward naval base.</p>

<p>The Marines welcomed the break
and the chance to walk on dry land
on the small islands of the atoll.
There was even an issue of warm
beer to all those on shore. The Marine
veterans of the fighting on Bougainville,
New Georgia, and
Eniwetok had a chance to look over
the soldiers of the 305th Regimental
Combat Team, which now came forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
from Oahu to be attached briefly
to the brigade for the landing on
Guam, set for 21 July and designated
W-Day. The rest of the Army contingent,
the 77th Infantry Division, was
well trained and well led, and was
scheduled to arrive at the target on
W plus 1, 22 July.</p>

<p>The 3d Marine Division, composed
of the 3d, 9th, and 21st Marines
(rifle regiments), the 12th
Marines (artillery), and the 19th Marines
(engineers and pioneers), plus
supporting troops, numbered 20,238
men. It had received its baptism of
fire on Bougainville in November
and December 1943 and spent the intervening
months on Guadalcanal
training and absorbing casualty
replacements. The 1st Provisional
Marine Brigade, which was organized
on Guadalcanal, was also a
veteran outfit. One of its infantry
regiments, the 4th Marines, was
formed from the disbanded raider
battalions which had fought in the
Solomons. The other once-separate
regiment, the 22d Marines, was
blooded in the seizure of Eniwetok
in February 1944. Both regiments
had 75mm pack howitzer battalions
attached, which now joined brigade
troops. In all, the brigade mustered
9,886 men.</p>

<p>Corps troops of the III Corps was
heavy with artillery and would use
every gun. III Corps had three battalions
of 155mm howitzers and guns
and the 9th and 14th Defense Battalions,
whose 90mm guns could and
would fire at both air and ground
targets.</p>

<p>For the handling of casualties, III
Corps had a medical battalion, with
equipment and supplies to operate a
1,500-bed hospital. In addition, the
1st Brigade had two medical companies;
the 3d Division its own medical
battalion; and the 77th Division a
fully staffed and equipped Army
field hospital. Each of the divisions
had a medium tank battalion and a
full complement of engineers, augmented
by two Marine separate engineer
battalions and two naval
construction battalions (Seabees).
Two amphibian tractor battalions
and an armored amphibian battalion
would carry the assault waves to
shore. All in all, the III Amphibious
Corps was prepared to land more
than 54,000 soldiers, sailors, and
Marines.</p>

<p>Waiting for the attack and sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
that it would come, but not where,
was the Japanese <i>29th Infantry Division</i>
under Lieutenant General
Takeshi Takashina. The <i>29th</i> had
served in Japan’s <i>Kwantung Army</i>,
operating and training in Manchuria
until it was sent to the Marianas in
February 1944. One of its regiments,
the <i>18th</i>, fell victim to an American
submarine, the <i>Trout</i>, and lost 2,200
of its 3,500 men when its transport
was sunk. Reorganized on Saipan,
the <i>18th Infantry Regiment</i> took two
infantry battalions to Guam, together
with two companies of tanks.</p>

<i>was killed on 28 July while directing
the evacuation of his Fonte defenses.</i></div></div>

<p>Another of the <i>29th</i>’s regiments
garrisoned Tinian and the remaining
unit, the <i>38th Infantry</i>, together with
division headquarters troops, arrived
on Guam in March. The other major
Army defending units were the <i>48th
Independent Mixed Brigade</i> and the
<i>10th Independent Mixed Regiment</i>,
both formed on Guam in March
from a six-battalion infantry, artillery,
and engineer force sent from
the <i>Kwantung Army</i>. With miscellaneous
supporting troops, the total
Army defending force numbered
about 11,500 men. Added to these
were 5,000 naval troops of the <i>54th
Keibitai</i> (guard force) and about
2,000 naval airmen reorganized as infantry
to defend Orote Peninsula and
its airfield. General Takashina was in
overall tactical command of the
18,500 Army and Navy defenders.
His immediate superior, Lieutenant
General Hideyoshi Obata, commanding
the <i>Thirty-first Army</i>, was
also on Guam, though not intentionally.
Returning to his Saipan headquarters
from an inspection trip to
the Palau Islands, Obata was trapped
on Guam by the American landing
on Saipan. He left the conduct of
Guam’s defense to Takashina.</p>

<p>The fact that the Americans were
to assault Guam was no secret to its
defenders. The invasion of Saipan
and a month-long bombardment by
ships and planes left only the question
of when and where. With only
15 miles of potential landing beaches
along the approachable west coast,
the Japanese could not be very wrong
no matter where they defended.</p>

<p>Major General Kiyoshi Shigematsu,
shoring up the morale of his <i>48th
Independent Mixed Brigade</i>, told his
men: “The enemy, overconfident because
of his successful landing on Saipan,
is planning a reckless and
insufficiently prepared landing on
Guam. We have an excellent opportunity
to annihilate him on the
beaches.”</p>

<p>Premier Hideki Tojo, supreme
commander of the war effort for
Japan, also had spirited words for his
embattled commanders: “Because the
fate of the Japanese empire depends
on the result of your operation, inspire
the spirit of officers and men
and to the very end continue to destroy
the enemy gallantly and persistently;
thus alleviate the anxiety of
the Emperor.”</p>

<p>Back to visit Guam a half century
later, a former Japanese lieutenant
said the tremendous American invasion
fleet offshore had “paved the sea”
and recalled what he thought on 21
July: “This is the day I will die.”</p>

<p>“Conditions,” said Admiral Conolly,
“are most favorable for a successful
landing.”</p>

Missouri and a graduate of
Texas A&amp;M in 1916, was commissioned
an Army second lieutenant in
June 1917. His association with the Marine
Corps goes back to World War I,
when as a member of the 2d Infantry Division’s
5th Machine Gun Battalion, he
participated in actions in France in the
Troyon Sector near Verdun, in the Aisne
Defensive operation near Chateau Thierry,
the Aisne-Marne offensive at Soissons,
the fighting at St. Mihiel, and the
Meuse-Argonne offensive at Blanc

<p>Troops of the 3d Marine Division
landed virtually in the lap of the
Japanese island commander, General
Takashina, whose U-shaped cave
command post, carved out of a sandstone
cliff, overlooked the Asan-Adelup
beachhead. The looming
heights dominated the beaches, particularly
on the left and center, where
the 3d and 21st Marines were headed
for the shore.</p>

<p>W-Day, 21 July 1944, opened as a
beautiful day, but it soon turned
hazy as the violent clouds of smoke,
dust, and fire spiraled skyward. At
0808 an air observer shouted into his
microphone: “First wave on the
beach.” At 0833, the same airborne
announcer confirmed the battle was
on, with: “Troops ashore on all
beaches.”</p>

<p>The 3d Marines under Colonel W.
Carvel Hall struck on the far left of
the 2,500-yard beachhead, the left
flank of the division near Adelup
Point. Ahead was Chonito Cliff, a
ridge later named Bundschu Ridge,
and high, difficult ground in back of
which was the final beachhead line
(FBHL), or first goal of the landing.
The center, straight up the middle,
belonged to the 21st Marines, under
Colonel Arthur H. “Tex” Butler. The
regiment would drive inland, secure
a line of cliffs, and defend them until
the division caught up and was ready
to expand the beachhead outward.
Under Colonel Edward A. Craig, the
9th Marines landed on the right flank
near Asan Point, ready to strike inland
over paddies to and across lower
and more hospitable hills, but all part
of the same formidable enemy-held
ridgeline.</p>

<p>The 3d Battalion, 9th Marines,
under Lieutenant Colonel Walter Asmuth,
Jr., caught intense fire from the
front and right flank near Asan
Point, and he had to call on tanks for
assistance, but one company got to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
the ridge ahead quite rapidly and
threw the defenders at Asan Point off
balance, making the regiment’s advance
easier. (It would also be up to
the 9th Marines to take Cabras, a little
island offshore and hard against
Apra Harbor. This would be accomplished
with a separate amphibious
landing.) With its 2d and 3d Battalions
in the lead, the 9th Marines
drove through its initial objectives
quickly and had to slacken its advance
in order not to thin out the division’s
lines.</p>

<p>Colonel Butler’s 21st Marines, in a
stroke of luck which would later be
called unbelievable, found two unguarded
defiles on either side of the
regiment’s zone of action. His troops
climbed straight to the clifftops. No
attempt was made to keep contact
going up, but, on top, the 2d and 3d
Battalions formed a bridge covering
both defiles. The 1st Battalion swept
the area below the cliffs.</p>

<p>The 12th Marines (Colonel John B.
Wilson) was quickly on the beach,
with its burdensome guns and equipment,
and the 3d Battalion of Lieutenant
Colonel Alpha L. Bowser, Jr.,
was registered and firing by 1215. By
1640 every battery was in position
and in support of the advance. Captain
Austin P. Gattis of the 12th Marines
attributed the success of his
regiment in setting up quickly to
“training, because we had done it
over, and over, and over. It was efficiency
learned and practiced and it
always gave the 12th a leg up.”</p>

<p>On the far left, the 3d Marines was
getting the worst of the enemy’s increasing
resistance. The regiment
received intense mortar and artillery
fire coming in and on the beaches,
and faced the toughest terrain&mdash;steep
cliffs whose approaches were laced
with interlocking bands of Japanese
machine gun fire. The cliffs were
defended by foes who knew and used
their weapons well. The Japanese,
that close, would roll grenades right
down the escarpment onto the Marines.
Snipers could find protection
and cover in the countless folds and
ridges of the irregular terrain, and the
ridgetops were arrayed like the
breastworks of some nightmarish
castle. It appeared that ten on top
could hold off hundreds below.</p>

<p>One of the defenders, Lieutenant
Kenichi Itoh, recalled that despite the
terrible bombardment, he felt secure,
that his countrymen could hold out
for a long time, even win. After the
war, recalling his feelings that eventful
day in July 1944, the lieutenant
considered it all a bad dream, “even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
absurd” to think that his forces could
ever withstand the onslaught.</p>

<p>On W-Day, Lieutenant Colonel
Ralph E. Houser’s 3d Battalion, 3d
Marines, was on the extreme left of
the line, facing Adelup Point, which,
with Asan Point, marked the right
and left flanks of the invasion
beaches. Houser’s troops could seize
the territory in his zone only with the
support of tanks from Company C,
3d Tank Battalion, and half-track-mounted
75mm guns. Holding up the
regimental advance was a little nose
projecting from Chonito Ridge facing
the invasion beach in the 1st Battalion,
3d Marines’ zone. Early on W-Day
(about 1045), Captain Geary R.
Bundschu’s Company A was able to
secure a foothold within 100 yards
of the crest of this promontory, but
could not hold its positions in the
face of intense enfilading machine
gun fire. Captain Bundschu called for
stretchers and corpsmen, then requested
permission to disengage.
Major Henry Aplington II, commanding
the 1st Battalion, was “unwilling
to give up ground in the tight
area and told Captain Bundschu to
hold what he had.”</p>

<p>Colonel Hall ordered the attack to
continue in mid-afternoon behind a
massive 81mm mortar barrage. None
of the companies of Major Aplington’s
battalion or Lieutenant Colonel
Hector de Zayas’ 2d Battalion could
gain any ground beyond what they
already precariously held. Their opponent,
the <i>320th Independent Infantry
Battalion</i> held fast.</p>

<p>A couple of hours later, Colonel
Hall ordered another attack, with
Companies A and E in the fore.
Major Aplington recalled:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When the 1700 attack went
off, it was no change. E made
little progress and the gallant
men of A Company attacked
again and again, reached the
top but could not hold. Geary
Bundschu was killed and the
company slid back to the former
positions.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the morning light of 22 July (W
plus 1), that small but formidable
Japanese position still held firmly
against the 3d Marines’ advance.
During the bitter fighting of the
previous day, Private First Class
Luther Skaggs, Jr., of the 3d Battalion,
led a mortar section through
heavy enemy fire to support the attack,
then defended his position
against enemy counterattacks during
the night although badly wounded.
For conspicuous gallantry and bravery
beyond the call of duty, he was
awarded the Medal of Honor. On the
22d, Private First Class Leonard F.
Mason, a Browning automatic rifleman
of the 2d Battalion, earned a
posthumous Medal of Honor for
single-handedly attacking and wiping
out an enemy machine gun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
position which threatened his unit.
Although wounded severely, he rejoined
his fellow Marines to continue
the attack, but succumbed to his fatal
wounds.</p>

<p>During the day’s bitter fighting,
Colonel Hall tried to envelop the
Japanese, using Companies A and C
of Aplington’s battalion and Company
E of de Zayas’. On regimental orders,
Aplington kicked it off at 1150.
It also got nowhere at first. Company
A got to the top but was thrown off.
Company E was able to move ahead
very slowly. Probe after probe, it
found Japanese resistance perceptibly
weakening. By 1900, the men of E
reached the top, above Company A’s
position. The Japanese had pulled

<p class="drop-cap tancap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> insignia of the 3d Marine
Division was adopted on 25
August 1943, when the division
was in training on Guadalcanal
for the upcoming invasion of Bougainville.
Approved in 3d Marine Division
Memorandum 274-43, the insignia
consisted of a caltrop on a triangular,
gold-bordered scarlet shield. The
caltrop was a medieval defensive
weapon used against both cavalry and
infantry. During the warfare of the
Middle Ages, large numbers of caltrops
were scattered by defenders on the
ground in front of an approaching enemy.
The four-pronged, forged-iron
caltrop was designed so that no matter
which way it landed when thrown
on the ground, one point would be up
with the other three points supporting
it. When used on the insignia, the
caltrop represented not only the 3d
Marine Division, but also the motto
painted on the drums carried by the
Continental Marines in the American
Revolution: “Don’t Tread on Me.”

<h2><a name="The_Southern_Beaches" id="The_Southern_Beaches"></a><i>The Southern Beaches</i></h2>

<p>In the south at Agat, despite
favorable terrain for the attack, the
1st Brigade found enemy resistance
at the beachhead to be more intense
than that which the 3d Division
found on the northern beaches.
Small arms and machine gun fire,
and the incessant fires of two 75mm
guns and a 37mm gun from a concrete
blockhouse with a four-foot
thick roof built into the nose of Gaan
Point, greeted the invading Marines
as the LVTs churned ashore. The
structure had been well camouflaged
and not spotted by photo interpreters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
before the landing nor, unfortunately,
selected as a target for bombing.
As a result, its guns knocked out two
dozen amtracs carrying elements of
the 22d Marines. For the assault
forces’ first hours ashore on W-Day
on the southern beaches, the Gaan
position posed a major problem.</p>

<div id="ip_12" class="figcenter" style="width: 668px;">

  <i>ASAN BEACHHEAD</i></p>

<p class="small">Only Approximate Form Lines Shown</p></div></div>

<p>The assault at Agat was treated to
the same thunderous naval gunfire
support which had disrupted and
shook the ground in advance of the
landings on the northern beaches at
Asan. When the 1st Brigade assault
wave was 1,000 yards from the
beach, hundreds of 4.5-inch rockets
from LCI(G)s (Landing Craft, Infantry,
Gunboat) slammed into the
strand. It would be the last of the
powerful support the troops of the
brigade in assault would get before
they touched down on Guam.</p>

<p>While the LVTs, the DUKWs (amphibious
trucks), and the LCVPs
were considerably off shore, there
was virtually no enemy fire from the
beach. An artillery observation plane
reported no observed enemy fire. The
defenders at Agat, however, <i>1st</i> and
<i>2d Battalions, 38th Infantry</i>, would
respond in their own time. The loss
of so many amtracs as the assault
waves neared the beaches meant
that, later in the day, there would not
be enough LVTs for the transfer of all
supplies and men from boats to amtracs
at the Agat reef. This shortage
of tractors would plague the brigade
until well after W-Day.</p>

<p>The damage caused to assault and
cargo craft on the reef, and the precision
of Japanese guns became real
concerns to General Shepherd. Some
of the Marines and most of the soldiers
who came in after the first assault
waves would wade ashore with full
packs, water to the waist or higher,
facing the perils of both underwater
shellholes and Japanese fire. Fortunately,
by the time the bulk of the
77th Division waded in, these twin
threats were not as great because the
Marines ashore were spread out and
keeping the Japanese occupied.</p>

<p>The Japanese Agat command had
prepared its defenses well with thick-walled
bunkers and smaller pillboxes.
The 75mm guns on Gaan Point
were in the middle of the landing
beaches. Crossfire from Gaan coordinated
with the machine guns on
nearby tiny Yona island to rake the
beaches allocated to the 4th Marines
under Lieutenant Colonel Alan
Shapley. The 4th Marines was to establish
its beachhead, and protect the
right or southernmost flank. After
bitter fighting, the 4th Marines
forged ahead on the low ground to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
its front and cleared Bangi Point
where bunker walls could withstand
a round from a battleship. Lieutenant
Colonel Shapley set up a block on
what was to be known as Harmon
Road leading down from the mountains
to Agat. A lesson well learned
in previous operations was that the
Japanese would be back in strength
and at night.</p>

<div class="captionl">
<p><i>In quick order, the 105mm howitzers of LtCol Alpha L. Bowser’s 3d Battalion, 12th
Marines, were landed and set up in camouflaged positions to support the attack.</i></p></div></div>

<p>When the Marines landed, they
found an excellent but undermanned
Japanese trench system on the
beaches, and while the pre-landing
bombardment had driven enemy
defenders back into their holes, they
nonetheless were able to pour heavy
machine gun and mortar fire down
on the invaders. Pre-landing planning
called for the Marine amtracs to
drive 1,000 yards inland before discharging
their embarked Marines,
but this tactic failed because of a
heavily mined beachhead, with its
antitank ditches and other obstacles.
However, the brigade attack ashore
was so heavy, with overwhelming
force the Marines were able to break
through, and by 1034, the assault
forces were 1,000 yards inland, and
the 4th Marines’ reserve battalion
had landed. After receiving extremely
heavy fire from all emplaced
Japanese forces, the Marines worked
on cleaning out bypassed bunkers
together with the now-landed tanks.
By 1330, the Gaan Point blockhouse
had been eliminated by taking the
position from the rear and blasting
the surprised enemy gunners before
they could offer effective resistance.
At this time also, the brigade command
group was on the beach and
General Shepherd had opened his
command post.</p>

<p class="small">TAKEN FROM A SCHEMATIC SKETCH DRAWN<br />

<p>The 22d Marines, led by Colonel
Merlin F. Schneider, was battered by
a hail of small arms and mortar fire
on hitting its assigned beach, and
suffered heavy losses of men and
equipment in the first minutes. Private
First Class William L. Dunlap
could vouch for the high casualties.
The dead, Dunlap recalled, included
the battalion’s beloved chaplain, who
had been entrusted with just about
everybody’s gambling money “to
hold for safekeeping,” the Marines
never for a minute considering that
he was just as mortal as they. The 1st
Battalion, 22d Marines (Lieutenant
Colonel Walfried H. Fromhold), had
left its section of the landing zone
and moved to the shattered town of
Agat, after which the battalion
would drive north and eventually
seal off heavily defended Orote
Peninsula, shortly to be the scene of
a major battle.</p>

<p>The 22d Marines’ 2d Battalion,
(Lieutenant Colonel Donn C. Hart),
in the center of the beachhead, quickly
and easily moved 1,000 yards
directly ahead inland from the beach.
The battalion could have gone on to
one of the W-Day goals, the local
heights of Mount Alifan, if American
bombs had not fallen short, halting
the attack.</p>

<p>The 1st Battalion moved into the
ruins of Agat and at 1020 was able to
say, “We have Agat,” although there
was still small arms resistance in the
rubble. By 1130 the battalion was
also out to Harmon Road, which led
to the northern shoulder of Mount
Alifan. Even as Fromhold’s men
made their advances, Japanese shells
hit the battalion aid station, wounding
and killing members of the medical
team and destroying supplies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
Not until later that afternoon was the
1st Battalion sent another doctor.</p>

<p>On the right of the landing waves,
Major Bernard W. Green’s 1st Battalion,
4th Marines, ran head-on into
a particularly critical hill mass (Hill
40) near Bangi Point, which had been
thoroughly worked over by the
Navy. Hill 40’s unexpectedly heated
defense indicated that the Japanese
recognized its importance, commanding
the beaches where troops
and supplies were coming ashore. It
took tanks and the support of the 3d
Battalion to claim the position.</p>

<p>Before dark on W-Day, the 2d Battalion,
22d Marines, could see the 4th
Marines across a deep gully. The latter
held a thin, twisted line extending
1,600 yards from the beach to
Harmon Road. The 22d Marines held
the rest of a beachhead 4,500 yards
long and 2,000 yards deep.</p>

<p>At nightfall of W-Day, General
Shepherd summed up to General
Geiger: “Own casualties about 350.
Enemy unknown. Critical shortages
of fuel and ammunition all types.
Think we can handle it. Will continue
as planned tomorrow.”</p>

<p>Helping to ensure that the Marines
would stay on shore once they landed
was a host of unheralded support
troops who had been struggling since
daylight to manage the flow of vital
supplies to the beaches. Now, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
W-Day’s darkness approached, the 4th
Ammunition Company, a black Marine
unit, guarded the brigade’s ammunition
depot ashore. During their
sleepless night, these Marines killed
14 demolition-laden infiltrators approaching
the dump.</p>

<p>Faulty communications delayed
the order to land the Army’s 305th
Regimental Combat Team (Colonel
Vincent J. Tanzola), elements of the
assault force, for hours. Slated for a
morning landing, the 2d Battalion of
Lieutenant Colonel Robert D. Adair
did not get ashore until well after
nightfall. As no amtracs were then
available, the soldiers had to walk in
from the reef. Some soldiers slipped
under water into shellholes and had
to swim for their lives in a full tide.
The rest of the 305th had arrived on
the beach, all wet, some seasick, by
0600 on W plus-1.</p>

<p>Guam July 24 (Delayed)&mdash;The first frontal attack on steep
Chonito Ridge was made one hour after the Marine
landing.</p>

<p>An infantry squad, led by Second Lieutenant James A.
Gallo, 24, 172 Broadway, Haverstraw, N.Y., approached
to within ten yards of the tip. The crest bloomed with
machine gun fire. In the face of it the Marine company tried
its first assault. The company was thrown back before it
had advanced forty yards.</p>

<p>For fifty hours the company remained on the naked
slope, trying again and again to storm the Jap entrenchments
hardly one hundred yards away. Battered almost to
annihilation, the tenacious Marines finally saw another
company take the ridge from the rear.</p>

<p>Failing in the first rush the company had formed a flimsy
defense line not fifty yards from the enemy. Cover was
scant. Some Marines had only tufts of grass to shield them.
The Japs were rolling grenades down the crest, and blasting
the Marines with knee mortars from over the summit.</p>

<p>Under the cover of dusk the company commander led
a second attack. As the Marines rose machine gun fire
swept into them. The commander, and three Marines
reached the crest. The last fifty feet were almost vertical.
The attackers grasped roots and dug their feet into the soft
earth to keep from falling down the incline.</p>

<p>The commander went over the ridge. He never came
back. The remaining three Marines were ripped by cross
fire. One saved himself by jumping into an enemy fox hole.</p>

<p>Beaten again, the company retired to a small ravine, and
remained there all night. One Marine, shot through both
legs, was asking for morphine. Another’s thigh was ripped
by shell fragments. A PFC, his dry tongue swollen, tried
to whisper the range of an enemy sniper.</p>

<p>At eleven in the morning of the 22d, with little more
than a third of their original number, the company rushed
the hillside again.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Gallo led an assault on the left flank of the
hill, but he was thrown back. Sergeant Charles V. Bomar,
33, 4002 Gulf St., Houston, Tex., with nine Marines attempted
to take the right ground of the slope. Five were
killed as they left the ravine. The sergeant and three others
reached the top of the slope.</p>

<p>The Japs again rolled grenades down the incline. One
exploded under the chest of a Marine nearby, blowing off
his head. Another grenade bounced off the helmet of the
sergeant. It was a dud.</p>

<p>The Marines charged into the Jap entrenchment. The sergeant
killed a Jap machine gunner with the butt of his carbine.
The assistant gunner exploded a grenade against his
body. The blast threw the Marines out of the hole. They
jumped into vacated enemy foxholes. A lieutenant who had
come to join them was shot between the eyes by a sniper.
The sergeant killed the sniper with his carbine.</p>

<p>Unable to hold their positions, the sergeant and his companies
returned to the shelter of the ravine. With the shattered
remnants of the company they waited for nearly
another 24 hours, until darting Marines on the top of the
ridge showed Chonito had been taken from the rear.

<h2><a name="Colonel_Suenaga_Attacks" id="Colonel_Suenaga_Attacks"></a><i>Colonel Suenaga Attacks</i></h2>

<p>Colonel Tsunetaro Suenaga, commanding
officer of the <i>38th Regiment</i>,
from his command post on
Mount Alifan, had seen the Americans
overwhelm his forces below.
Desperate to strike back, he telephoned
General Takashina at 1730 to
get permission for an all-out assault
to drive the Marines into the sea. He
had already ordered his remaining
units to assemble for the counterattack.
The <i>29th Division</i> commander
was not at first receptive. Losses
would be too high and the <i>38th Regiment</i>
would serve better defending
the high ground and thereby
threatening the American advance.
Reluctantly however, Takashina
gave his permission, and ordered the
survivors to fall back on Mount
Alifan if the attack failed, which he
was certain it would. Eventually
Colonel Suenaga was forced to share
the general’s pessimism, for he
burned his regiment’s colors to prevent
their capture.</p>

<p>At the focal point of the enemy’s
attack from the south, Hill 40, the
brunt of the fighting fell upon First
Lieutenant Martin J. “Stormy” Sexton’s
Company K, 3d Battalion, 4th
Marines. The enemy’s <i>3d Battalion,
38th Regiment</i> coming north from
reserve positions was still relatively
intact. In the face of Japanese assaults,
the company held, but just
barely. Sexton recalls Lieutenant
Colonel Shapley’s assessment of the
night’s fighting: “If the Japanese had
been able to recapture Hill 40, they
could have kicked our asses off the
Agat beaches.”</p>

<p>Major Anthony N. “Cold Steel”
Walker, S-3 (operations officer) of the
3d Battalion, recalled that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
Japanese, an estimated 750 men, hit
the company at about 2130, with the
main effort coming to the left or east
of the hill. He remembered:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Finding a gap in our lines and
overrunning the machine gun
which covered the gap the enemy
broke through and advanced
toward the beaches.
Some elements turned to their
left and struck Hill 40 from the
rear. K Company with about
200 men fought them all night
long from Hill 40 and a small
hill to the rear and northeast of
Hill 40. When daylight came the
Marines counterattacked with
two squads from L Company
... and two tanks ... and
closed the gap. A number of
men from Company K died that
night but all 750 Japanese soldiers
were killed. The hill ...
represents in miniature or symbolically
the whole hard-fought
American victory on Guam.</p></blockquote>

<p>Along the rest of the Marine front,
and in the reserve areas, the fighting
was hot and heavy as the rest of the
<i>38th</i> attacked. Colonel Suenaga
pushed his troops to attack again and
again, in many cases only to see them
mowed down in the light of American
flares. No novice to Japanese tactics,
General Shepherd had
anticipated this first night’s attack
and was ready.</p>

<p class="small">Taken From TF 53 Op Plan A162-44</p></div></div>

<p>Enemy reconnaissance patrols
were numerous around 2130, trying
to draw fire and determine Marine
positions. Colonel Suenaga was out
in front of the center thrust which began
at 2330 after a brisk mortar flurry
on the right flank of the 4th
Marines. The Japanese came on in
full force, yelling, charging with their
rifles carried at high port, and throwing
grenades. The Marines watched
the dark shadows moving across the
skyline under light of star shells from
the ships. Men lined up hand grenades,
watched, waited, and then reacted.
The Japanese were all around,
attempting to bayonet Marines in
their foxholes. They even infiltrated
down to pack-howitzer positions in
the rear of the front lines. It was the
same for the 22d Marines. A whole
company of Japanese closed to the vicinity
of the regimental command
post. The defense here was held
largely by a reconnaissance platoon
headed by Lieutenant Dennis Chavez,
Jr., who personally killed five of
the infiltrators at point-blank range
with a Thompson sub-machine gun.</p>

<p>Four enemy tanks in that same attack
lumbered down Harmon Road.
There they met a bazooka man from
the 4th Marines, Private First Class
Bruno Oribiletti. He knocked out the
first two enemy tanks and Marine
Sherman tanks of Lieutenant James
R. Williams’ 4th Tank Company platoon
finished off the rest. Oribiletti
was killed; he was posthumously
awarded the Navy Cross for his bravery.
Enemy troops of the <i>38th</i> also
stumbled into the barely set up
perimeter of the newly arrived 305th
Infantry and paid heavily for it.</p>

<p>After one day and night of furious
battle the <i>38th</i> ceased to exist. Colonel
Suenaga, wounded in the first night’s
counterattack, continued to flail at
the Marines until he, too, was cut
down. Takashina ordered the shattered
remnants of the regiment north
to join the reserves he would need to
defend the high ground around Fonte
Ridge above the Asan-Adelup beachhead.
The general would leave his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
troops on Orote to fend for themselves.</p>

<hr />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="Fonte_Ridge" id="Fonte_Ridge"></a><i>Fonte Ridge</i></h2>

<p>The two days of fierce fighting on
the left of the 3d Division’s beachhead
in the area that was now
dubbed Bundschu Ridge cost the 3d
Marines 615 men killed, wounded,
and missing. The 21st Marines in the
center held up its advance on 22 July
until the 3d Marines could get moving,
but the men in their exposed positions
along the top of the ridge,
seized so rapidly on W-Day, were
hammered by Japanese mortar fire,
so much so that Colonel Butler
received permission to replace the 2d
Battalion by the 1st, which had been
in division reserve. The 9th Marines
met relatively little resistance as it
overran many abandoned Japanese
positions in its drive toward the
former American naval base at Piti
on the shore of Apra Harbor. The 3d
Battalion, after a heavy barrage of
naval gunfire and bombs, assaulted
Cabras Island in mid-afternoon,
landing from LVTs to find its major
obstacle dense brambles with
hundreds of mines.</p>

<p>General Turnage, assessing the situation
as he saw it on the eve of 22
July reported to General Geiger:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Enemy resistance increased
considerably today on Div left
and center. All Bn’s of 3rd CT
[combat team] have been committed
in continuous attack
since landing. 21st CT less 1 Bn
in Div Res has been committed
continuously with all units in
assault. One of the assault Bn’s
of 21st CT is being relieved on
line by Div Res Bn today. Former
is approx 40 percent depleted.
Since further advance will
continue to thin our lines it is
now apparent that an additional
CT is needed. 9th CT is fully
committed to the capture of
Piti and Cabras. Accordingly it
is urgently recommended that
an additional CT be attached
this Div at the earliest practicable
date.</p></blockquote>

<p>Turnage did not get the additional
regiment he sought. The night of W
plus 1 was relatively quiet in the 3d
Division’s sector except for the 1st
Battalion, 21st Marines, which
repulsed a Japanese counterattack
replete with a preliminary mortar
barrage followed by a bayonet
charge.</p>

<p>On the 23d, III Amphibious Corps
Commander, General Geiger, well
aware that the majority of Japanese
troops had not yet been encountered,
told the 3d Division that it was “essential
that close contact between adjacent
units be established by later
afternoon and maintained throughout
the night” unless otherwise
directed. Despite the order to close
up and keep contact, the 3d Division
was spread too thinly to hold what
it had seized in that day’s advance.
When it halted to set up for the night,
it was found that the distance between
units had widened. When
night fell, the frontline troops essentially
held strongpoints with gaps between
them covered by interlocking
bands of fire.</p>

<p>The 3d Marines reached the high
ground of Bundschu Ridge on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
23d and searched out the remaining
Japanese stragglers. It was obvious
that the enemy had withdrawn from
the immediate area and equally plain
that the Japanese hadn’t gone far.
When patrols from the 21st Marines
tried to link up with the 3d Marines,
they were driven back by the fire of
cleverly hidden machine guns, all but
impossible to spot in the welter of undergrowth
and rock-strewn ravines.
All across the ridges that the Marines
held, there were stretches of deadly
open ground completely blanketed
by enemy fire from still higher positions.
On the night of the 23d, the
9th Marines made good progress
moving through more open territory
which was dotted by hills, each of
which was a potential enemy bastion.
A patrol sent south along the
shoreline to contact the 1st Brigade
took fire from the hills to its left and
ran into an American artillery and
naval gunfire concentration directed
at Orote’s defenders. The patrol was
given permission to turn back.</p>

<p><i>Mount Alifan looms over the men of the 4th Marines as they move through the
foothills to the attack. In the background, a plane being used for observation keeps
track of the front lines for controlling the fire of ships’ guns and supporting artillery.</i></p></div></div>

<p>On the 24th, the 3d and 21st Marines
finally made contact on the
heights, but the linkup was illusory.
There were no solid frontlines, only
strongpoints. No one could be certain
that the Japanese had all been
accounted for in the areas that had
been probed, attacked, and now
seemed secure. Every rifleman was
well aware that more of the same lay
ahead; he could see his next objectives
looming to the front, across the
Mount Tenjo Road, which crossed
the high ground that framed the
beachhead. Already the division had
suffered more than 2,000 casualties,
the majority in infantry units. And
yet the Japanese, who had lost as
many and more men in the north
alone, were showing no signs of
abandoning their fierce defense.
General Takashina was, in fact, husbanding
his forces, preparing for an
all-out counterattack, just as the Marines,
north and south, were getting
ready to drive to the force beachhead
line (FBHL), the objective which
would secure the high ground and
link up the two beachheads.</p>

<p>Since the American landings,
Takashina had been bringing troops
into the rugged hills along the Mount
Tenjo Road, calling in his reserves
from scattered positions all over the
island. By 25 July, he had more than
5,000 men, principally of the <i>48th Independent
Mixed Brigade</i> and the
<i>10th Independent Mixed Regiment</i>,
assembled and ready to attack.</p>

<p>The fighting on the 25th was as intense
as that on any day since the
landing. The 2d Battalion, 9th Marines
(Lieutenant Colonel Robert E.
Cushman, Jr., who was to become
the 25th Commandant of the Marine
Corps in 1972), was attached to the
3d Marines to bring a relatively intact
unit into the fight for the Fonte
heights and to give the badly battered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
1st Battalion, 3d Marines, a chance
to rest and recoup. By nightfall,
Cushman’s men had driven a salient
into the Japanese lines, seizing the
Mount Tenjo Road, 400 yards short
of the Fonte objective on the left and
250 yards short on the right.</p>

<p>During the day’s relentless and increasingly
heavy firefights, the 2d
and 3d Battalions of the 3d Marines
had blasted and burned their way
through a barrier of enemy cave
defenses and linked up with Cushman’s
outfit on the left. About 1900,
Company G of the 9th Marines
pulled back some 100 yards to a position
just forward of the road, giving
it better observation and field of
fire. Company F had reached and occupied
a rocky prominence some 150
yards ahead of Companies G and E,
in the center of the salient. It pulled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
back a little for better defense, and
held. Thus the scene was set for the
pitched battle of Fonte Ridge, fought
at hand-grenade range and in which
casualties on both sides were largely
caused by small arms fire at point-blank
distances. It was in this action
that leadership, doggedness, and organizational
skill under fire merited
the award of the Medal of Honor
to the Commanding Officer of Company
F, Captain Louis H. Wilson, Jr.,
who became the 26th Commandant

<p>Captain Wilson organized and led
the 17-man patrol which climbed the
slope in the face of the same continued
enemy fire to seize the critical
high ground at Fonte and keep it.</p>

<p>A half century later, Colonel Fraser
E. West recalled the engagement at
Fonte as bitter, close, and brisk. As
a young officer, he commanded
Company G, and reinforced Wilson’s
unit. West joined on Company F’s
flank, then reconnoitered to spot enemy
positions and shared the night in
a common CP with Captain Wilson.</p>

<p>In late afternoon of the 25th, a platoon
of four tanks of Company C,
3d Tank Battalion, had made its way
up to the Mount Tenjo Road and
gone into position facing the most
evident Japanese strongpoints. At the
height of the battle by Wilson’s and
West’s companies to hold their positions,
First Lieutenant Wilcie A.
O’Bannon, executive officer of Company
F, managed to get down slope
from his exposed position and bring
up two of these tanks. By use of telephones
mounted in the rear of the
tanks to communicate with the Marines
inside, Lieutenant O’Bannon
was able to describe targets for the
tankers, as he positioned them in
support of Wilson’s and West’s Marines.
West recalled the tanks came
up with a precious cargo of ammunition.
He and volunteers stuffed
grenades in pockets, hung bandoleers
over their shoulders, pocketed clips,
carried grenade boxes on their shoulders,
and delivered them all as they
would birthday presents along the
line to Companies G and F and a remaining
platoon of Company E.
Major West was also able to use a
tank radio circuit to call in naval gunfire,
and guarantee that the terrain
before him would be lit all night by
star shells and punished by high explosive
naval gunfire.</p>

<p>On the morning of 26 July, 600
Japanese lay dead in front of the 2d
Battalion, 9th Marines positions. But
the battle was not over. General Turnage
ordered the military crest of the
reverse slope taken. There would be
other Japanese counterattacks, fighting
would again be hand-to-hand,
but by 28 July, the capture of Fonte
was in question no longer. Companies
E, F, and G took their objectives
on the crest. Lieutenant Colonel
Cushman’s battalion in four murderous
days had lost 62 men killed and
179 wounded.</p>

<p>It was not any easier for the 21st
Marines with its hard fighting in the
morning of the 25th. Only by
midafternoon did that regiment clear
the front in the center of the line. The
2d Battalion, 21st Marines, had to
deal with a similar pocket of die-hards
as that which had held up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
2d Battalion, 9th Marines, on Fonte.
Holed up in commanding cave positions
in the eastern draw of the Asan
River, just up from the beachhead,
the Japanese were wiped out only after
repeated Marine attacks and
close-in fighting. The official history
of the campaign noted that “every
foot of ground that fell to Lieutenant
Colonel [Eustace R.] Smoak’s Marines
was paid for in heavy casualties,
and every man available was
needed in the assault....”</p>

<p>The 9th Marines under Colonel
Craig made good progress on the
25th from its morning jump-off and
reached the day’s objective, a line
running generally along the course of
a local river (the Sasa) by 0915. The
9th Marines had taken even more
ground than was planned. General
Turnage was then able to reposition
the 9th Marines for the harder fighting
on the beleaguered left. The 2d
Battalion pulled out of position to
reinforce the 3d Marines and the remaining
two battalions spread out a
little further in position.</p>

<p>The determined counterattack that
hit the 3d Marines on the night of
25&ndash;26 July was matched in intensity
all across the 3d Division’s front. It
wasn’t long before there were enemy
troops roaming the rear areas as they
slipped around the Marine
perimeters and dodged down stream
valleys and ravines leading to the
beaches.</p>

<p>Major Aplington, whose 1st Battalion,
3d Marines, now constituted
the only division infantry reserve,
held positions in the hills on the left
in what had been a relatively quiet
sector. Not for long, he recalled:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>With the dark came heavy
rain. Up on the line Marines
huddled under ponchos in their
wet foxholes trying to figure out
the meaning of the obvious activity
on the part of the opposing
Japanese. Around midnight
there was enemy probing of the
lines of the 21st [Marines], and
slopping over into those of the
9th [Marines].... All was quiet
in our circle of hills and we
received no notification when
the probing increased in intensity
or at 0400 when the enemy
opened ... his attack.... My
first inkling came at about 0430
when my three companies on
the hills erupted into fire and
called for mortar support. I
talked to the company commanders
and asked what was
going on to be told that there
were Japanese all around them
... the Japanese had been close.
Three of my dead had been
killed by bayonet thrusts.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the 1st Battalion, 9th Marines,
sector, Private Dale Fetzer, a dog handler
assigned with his black Labrador
Retriever alerted Company C. The
dog, Skipper, who had been asleep
in front of his handler’s foxhole suddenly
bolted upright, alerting Fetzer.
Skipper’s nose was pointed up and
directly toward Mount Tenjo. “Get
the lieutenant!” called handler Fetzer,
“They’re coming.”</p>

<p>At about 0400, the Japanese troops
poured down the slopes in a frenzied
<i>banzai</i> attack. Japanese troops had
been sighted drinking during the afternoon
in the higher hills, and some
of these attackers appeared drunk.
Marine artillery fire had immediately
driven them to cover then, but they
apparently continued to prepare for
the attack.</p>

<p>In the area of the 21st Marines,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
along a low ridge not far from the
critical Mount Tenjo Road, the human
wave struck hard against the 3d
Battalion and the Japanese actually
seized a machine gun which was
quickly recaptured by the Marines.
The 3d Division was holding a front
of some 9,000 yards at the time, and
it was thinnest from the right of the
21st Marines to the left of the 9th
Marines. Much of that line was only
outposted. The 3d Battalion, 21st
Marines, held throughout. Some of
the raiders got through the weakly
manned gap between the battalions.
They charged harum-scarum for the
tanks, artillery, and ammunition and
supply dumps. The attack seemed
scattered, however, and unorganized.
The fighting was fierce, nonetheless,
and it shattered the hastily erected
Marine roadblock between the battalions.</p>

<p>Some of the attackers got through
the lines all along the front. A group
of about 50 reached the division
hospital. Doctors evacuated the badly
wounded, but the walking wounded
joined with cooks, bakers,
stretcher bearers, and corpsmen to
form the line that fought off the attackers.
One of the patients, Private
First Class Michael Ryan, “grabbed
up the blanket covering me and ran
out of the building without another
stitch on.” He had to run with a
wounded foot through crossfire to
reach some safety.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel George O. Van
Orden (3d Division infantry training
officer), on orders from General Turnage,
assembled two companies of
the 3d Pioneer Battalion to eliminate
this threat. In three hours the pioneers
killed 33 of the assailants and
lost three of their own men. The 3d
Medical Battalion had 20 of its men
wounded, but only one patient was
hit and he was one of the defenders.</p>

<p>For many men in the furious and
confused melees that broke out all
over the Marine positions, the experience
of Corporal Charles E.
Moore of the 2d Platoon, Company
E, 2d Battalion, 3d Marines, wasn’t
unique. His outfit held a position
about a quarter mile from Fonte
Plateau. He recalled:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We set up where a road made
a sharp turn overlooking a
draw. It was the last stand of
the second platoon. There were
three attacks that night and by
the third there was nobody left
to fight, so they broke through.
They came in droves throwing
hand grenades and hacked up
some of our platoon. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
morning, I had only ten rounds
of ammunition left, half the clip
for my BAR. I was holding
those rounds if I needed them
to make a break for it. I had no
choice. Everybody was quiet,
either dead or wounded. The
Japanese came in to take out
their dead and wounded, and
stepped on the edge of my foxhole.
I didn’t breath. They were
milling around there until dawn
then they were gone.</p></blockquote>

<p>As Lieutenant Colonel Cushman,
evaluating the action later, said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>With the seizure of Fonte
Hill, the capture of the beachhead
was completed. In the
large picture, the defeat of the
large counterattack on the 26th
by the many battalions of the
3d Division who fought valiantly
through the bloody night
finished the Jap on Guam....
What made the fighting
for Fonte important was the fact
that [the advance to the north
end of the island] could not take
place until it was seized.</p></blockquote>

<p>The enemy attack failed in the
south also, and in the south it was
just as much touch and go at times.
The Japanese sailors on Orote were
just as determined as the soldiers at
Fonte to drive the Americans from
Guam.</p>

<p class="drop-cap al tancap"><span class="smcap1">As</span> a 29-year-old lieutenant
colonel commanding the 2d
Battalion, 9th Marines, 3d
Marine Division, on Guam, Robert E.
Cushman, Jr., was awarded the Navy
Cross for extraordinary heroism during
the period 21 July to 30 August 1944.
The medal citation states in part:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When his battalion was ordered
to seize and hold a strongly organized
and defended enemy
strong-point which had been holding
up the advance for some days,
Lieutenant Colonel Cushman
directed the attacks of his battalion
and the repulse of numerous
Japanese counterattacks, fearlessly
exposing himself to heavy
hostile rifle, machine gun and
mortar fire in order to remain in
the front lines and obtain first
hand knowledge of the enemy situation.
Following three days of bitter
fighting culminating in a heavy
Japanese counterattack which
pushed back the flank of his battalion,
he personally led a platoon
into the gap and, placing it for
defense, repelled the hostile force.
By his inspiring leadership,
courage and devotion to duty, he
contributed materially to the success
of the mission with the annihilation
of one enemy battalion
and the rout of another....</p></blockquote>

<p>General Cushman became the 25th
Commandant of the Marine Corps on 1
January 1972. Interestingly enough, he
was succeeded four years later by General
Louis H. Wilson, Jr., who commanded
a company in Cushman’s 2d
Battalion, 9th Marines, on Guam.

<p class="drop-cap tancap"><span class="smcap1">Captain</span> Louis Hugh Wilson,
Jr.’s Medal of Honor citation
reads as follows: “For conspicuous
gallantry and intrepidity at
the risk of his life above and beyond
the call of duty as commanding officer
of a rifle company attached to the 2d
Battalion, 9th Marines, 3d Marine Division,
in action against enemy
Japanese forces at Fonte Hill, Guam,
25&ndash;26 July 1944. Ordered to take that
portion of the hill within his zone of
action, Captain Wilson initiated his attack
in midafternoon, pushed up the
rugged, open terrain against terrific
machine gun and rifle fire for 300 yards
and successfully captured the objective.
Promptly assuming command of other
disorganized units and motorized
equipment in addition to his own company
and one reinforcing platoon, he
organized his night defenses in the face
of continuous hostile fire and,
although wounded three times during
this 5-hour period, completed his disposition
of men and guns before retiring
to the company command post for
medical attention. Shortly thereafter,
when the enemy launched the first of
a series of savage counterattacks lasting
all night, he voluntarily rejoined
his besieged units and repeatedly exposed
himself to the merciless hail of
shrapnel and bullets, dashing 50 yards
into the open on one occasion to rescue
a wounded Marine laying helpless
beyond the front lines. Fighting fiercely
in hand-to-hand encounters, he led his
men in furiously waged battle for approximately
10 hours, tenaciously
holding his line and repelling the fanatically
renewed counter-thrusts until
he succeeded in crushing the last
efforts of the hard-pressed Japanese
early the following morning. Then organizing
a 17-man patrol, he immediately
advanced upon a strategic slope
essential to the security of his position
and, boldly defying intense mortar,
machine gun and rifle fire which struck
down 13 of his men, drove relentlessly
forward with the remnants of his
patrol to seize the vital ground. By his
indomitable leadership, daring combat
tactics, and valor in the face of overwhelming
odds, Captain Wilson succeeded
in capturing and holding the
strategic high ground in his regimental
sector, thereby contributing essentially
to the success of his regimental
mission and to the annihilation of 350
Japanese troops. His inspiring conduct
throughout the critical periods of this
decisive action sustains and enhances
the highest traditions of the United
States naval service.”

<h3 class="nobreak p0">The Colt .45-Caliber M1911A1 Pistol</h3>

<p class="drop-cap tancap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> Colt M1911A1 pistol was standard issue to
many Marine officers, noncommissioned
officers, and specialists not armed with either the
M1 carbine or rifle during World War II. From 1911, this
pistol served its Marine owners as well as members of the
other U.S. services armed with it.</p>

<p>The first M1911 pistols were issued to the Marine Corps
in 1912, and shortly afterwards the Corps was able to field
this pistol exclusively. Although Colt manufactured more
than 55,000 pistols by the time the United States entered
World War I, not enough were on hand to preclude arming
some units of the American Expeditionary Force with
revolvers. Subsequently, more than a half million M1911s
were produced before 1926, when the M1911 was modified
and the revised pistol now dubbed the M1911A1.</p>

<p>These modifications included a shorter, and serrated,
trigger; wider sights; a contoured handgrip; and a longer
grip safety. Approximately 1.8 million of the newer
M1911A1s were produced and the M1911s also were upgraded
to meet these new specifications during World War
II. The advent of World War II also meant further changes
for the pistol. Among these was altering the finish from
the common shiny blue-black to a dull gray, in the process
called “Parkerization,” which was designed to give the pistol
a nonreflective matte surface. Wartime M1911A1s also
sported checkered plastic grips instead of molded rubber.</p>

<p>Colt could not keep up with wartime demand, and the
following firms were licensed to produce the M1911A1:
Remington Arms Company, North American Arms Company
Limited, Remington-Rand Company, Ithaca Gun
Company, Union Switch and Signal Company, and Singer
Sewing Machine Company. One curious note is that the
Remington-Rand Company actually outproduced Colt during
the wartime years by approximately 500,000 pistols.</p>

<p>During the war, in its table of equipment, a Marine division
rated 1,707 pistols, but the actual number it had was
in general substantially higher; a tribute to the popularity
of the M1911A1. A number of Marine aviators, given the
option, chose the .45-caliber Colt over the .38-caliber Smith
&amp; Wesson “Victory” revolver.</p>

<h2><a name="Orote" id="Orote"></a><i>Orote</i></h2>

<p>The 22d Marines had driven up
the coast from Agat in a series of
hard-fought clashes with stubborn
enemy defenders. The 4th Marines
had swept up the slopes of Mount
Alifan and secured the high ground
overlooking the beachhead. By the
25th, the brigade was in line across
the mouth of Orote Peninsula facing
a formidable defensive line in depth,
anchored in swamps and low hillocks,
concealed by heavy undergrowth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
and bristling with automatic
weapons.</p>

<div id="ip_27" class="figcenter" style="width: 429px;">

</div>

<p>The 77th Infantry Division had
taken over the rest of the southern
beachhead, relieving the 4th Marines
of its patrolling duties to the south
and in the hills to the west. The division’s
artillery and a good part of
the III Corps’ big guns hammered the
Japanese on Orote without letup. Just
in case of enemy air attack, the beach
defenses from Agat to Bangi Point
were manned by the 9th Defense Battalion.
There were not too many
Japanese planes in the sky, and so the
antiaircraft artillerymen could concentrate
on firing across the water
into the southern flank of the enemy’s
Orote positions. On Cabras Island,
the 14th Defense Battalion moved
into position where it could equally
provide direct flanking fire on the
peninsula’s northern coast and stand
ready to elevate its guns to fire at enemy
planes in the skies above.</p>

<p>The 5,000 Japanese defenders on
Orote took part in General Takashina’s
all-out counterattack and it began
in the early morning hours of 26
July. The attackers stormed vigorously
out of the concealing mangrove
swamp and the response was just as
spirited. Here, as in the north, there
was evidence that some of the attackers
had fortified themselves with <i>sake</i>
and there were senseless actions by
officers who attacked the Marine
tanks armed only with their <i>samurai</i>
swords. There were deadly and
professional attacks as well, with
Marines bayoneted in their foxholes.
There was one attendant communications
breakdown obliging Captain
Robert Frank, commanding officer of
Company L, 22d Marines, to remain
on the front relaying artillery spots
to the regimental S-2 and thence to
brigade artillery.</p>

  <div class="captionl"><i>Stretchers for wounded Marines lie scattered among the bodies
of Japanese dead in the wake of the attack on the 3d Division
hospital the evening of 25&ndash;26 July. Doctors, corpsmen,
and wounded Marines joined in the fight to repulse the enemy.</i></div></div>

<p>The artillery response was intense
and effective. The fire was “drawn in
closer and closer toward our front
lines; 26,000 shells were thrown into
the pocket [of attackers] between
midnight and 3 a.m.” The screaming
attacks came at 1230, then again at
0130, and at 0300. At daylight the
muddy ground in front of the Marine
positions was slick with blood.
More than 400 Japanese bodies were
sprawled in the driving rain.</p>

<p>General Shepherd, secure in the
knowledge that his frontline troops,
4th Marines on the left, 22d Marines
on the right, had withstood the
night’s <i>banzai</i> attacks in good order,
directed an attack to be launched
at 0730. But first there would be
another artillery preparation. At
daybreak it opened with the 77th Infantry
Division’s 105s and 155s, the
brigade’s 75s, the defense battalion’s
90s, and whatever guns the 12th Marines
could spare. It was one of the
more intense preparations of the
campaign. Major Charles L. Davis,
S-3 of 77th Division Artillery,
recalled how, on the request of
General Shepherd, he had turned the
heavy 155mm battalion and two
105mm battalions around to face
Orote to soften the Japanese positions.
The 155s and 105s battered
well-prepared positions, and ripped
the covering, protection, and
camouflage from bunkers and
trenches. Pieces of men soon hung in
trees. Marines saw that this fire
counted and made it a point to return
to congratulate and thank the 77th’s
artillery section leaders.</p>

<p>The advance, when it came, only
went 100 yards before it was addressed
by a blistering front of
machine gun and small arms fire.
Enemy artillery fire came falling
almost simultaneously with the cessation
of American support, leaving
the Marines to think the fire was
from their own guns, a favorite
Japanese ruse. For a moment there,
the Japanese return fire on the 22d
Marines disorganized its forward
move. It was about 0815 before the
attack was on again in full force,
spearheaded by Marine and Army
tanks.</p>

<p>Immediately to the front of the 22d
Marines was the infernal mangrove
swamp from where the <i>banzai</i> attack
had been mounted the night before.
It was still manned heavily by
Japanese, was dense, and the only
means of penetrating it was by a
200-yard-long corridor along the
regimental boundary which was covered
by Japanese enfilade fire and
could only be navigated with the
cover of tanks. The armor gunners
and commanders directed their fire
just over the head of prone Marines
and into the gunports of enemy pillboxes.
By 1245, Colonel Schneider’s
regiment had worked its way
through all bottlenecks past the mangrove
swamps, destroying bunkers
with demolitions and flamethrowers.
The 4th’s assault battalions kept pace
with this advance, finding somewhat
easier terrain but just as determined
defenders. By evening the brigade
had advanced 1,500 yards from its
jump-off line. Both regiments, weary,
wary, and waiting, dug in with an all-around
defense.</p>

<p>Again, there was a heavy pre-attack
barrage on the 27th and the
Marines were stopped again before
they’d gone 100 yards. The 3d Battalion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
4th Marines, facing a well-defended
ridge, a coconut grove, and
a sinister clearing, was nearing the
sentimental and tactically important
goals of the old Marine barracks, its
rifle range, and the runways of Orote
airfield. With heavy tank support,
the 22d Marines surged forward past
the initial obstacles and by afternoon
had reached positions well beyond
the morning’s battles. On the left of
the 4th Marines, where resistance
was lighter, the assault was led by
tanks that beat down the brush.
While inspecting positions there,
Lieutenant Colonel Samuel D. Puller,
the 4th’s executive officer and brother
of famed Lieutenant Colonel Lewis B.
“Chesty” Puller, was killed by a
sniper.</p>

<p>By mid-afternoon, the 4th Marines’
assault elements broke out of
the grove just short of the rifle range,
only to stall in a new complex at dug-in
defenses and minefields. Strangely,
and yet not unusual in the climax of
a losing engagement, a Japanese
officer emerged to brandish his sword
at a tank. It was easier than ritual
suicide.</p>

<p>The horror of the American guns
again must have been too much for
the Japanese defending the immediate
front. Surprisingly, they just cut
and ran from their strong, well-defended
positions. The elated Marines,
who did not care why the
enemy ran&mdash;just that they ran&mdash;now
dug in only 300 yards from the prized
targets. Their capture would wait for
tomorrow, 28 July. The Japanese
were now squeezed into the last
quadrant of the peninsula. All of
their strongly entrenched defenses
had failed to hold. The Orote airfield,
the old Marine barracks, the
old parade ground which had not felt
an American boot since 10 December
1941, were all about to be retrieved.</p>

<p>General Shepherd sounded a great
reveille on 28 July for what was left
of the Japanese naval defenders: a
45-minute air strike and a 30-minute
naval gunfire bombardment, joined
by whatever guns the 77th Division,
brigade, and antiaircraft battalions
could muster. At 0830 the brigade
would attack for Orote airfield.</p>

<p>Colonel Schneider’s 22d Marines
would take the barracks and Sumay
and Colonel Shapley’s 4th Marines
would take the airfield and the rifle
range. Japanese artillery and mortar
fire had diminished, but small arms
and machine guns still spoke intensely
when the Marines attacked. At
this bitter end, the Japanese were
evoking a last-ditch stubbornness.
American tanks were called up but
most had problems with visibility
and control. Wherever the thick
scrub brush concealed the enemy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
Major John S. Messers’ 2d Battalion,
4th Marines called for increased tank
support when one of his companies
began taking heavy casualties. In
response to General Shepherd’s request,
General Bruce sent forward a
platoon of Army tank destroyers and
a platoon of light tanks to beef up the
attack.</p>

<p>General Shepherd wanted the battle
over now. He ordered a massive
infantry and tank attack which
kicked off at 1530 on the 28th. The
Japanese did not intend to oblige this
time by quitting; this was do or die.
By nightfall all objectives were in
plain sight, but there were still a few
hundred yards to be gained. The Marines
stood fast for the night, hoping
the Japanese would sacrifice themselves
in counterattack, but no such
luck occurred.</p>

<p>When the attack resumed on the
29th, after the usual Army and Marine
artillery preparation and an awesomely
heavy air strike, Army and
Marine tanks led the way onto the
airfield. Resistance was meager. By
early afternoon, the airfield was secured
and the 22d Marines had occupied
what was left of the old
Marine barracks. A bronze plaque,
which had long been mounted at the
entrance to the barracks, was recovered
and held for reinstallation at
a future date.</p>

<p>The Japanese found this latest advance
difficult to accept. Suicides
were many and random. Soldiers
jumped off cliffs, hugged exploding
grenades, even cut their own throats.</p>

<p>Private First Class George F.
Eftang, with the 4th Marines’ supporting
pack howitzer battalion, saw
the suicides: “I could see the Japanese
jumping to their deaths. I actually
felt sorry for them. I knew they had
families and sweethearts like anyone
else.”</p>

<p>While the embattled peninsula still
swarmed with patrols, Admiral Spruance;
Generals Smith, Geiger, Larsen
(the future island commander), and
Shepherd; Colonels Shapley and
Schneider, and others who could be
spared, arrived for a ceremonial flag
raising and heartfelt tribute to an old
barracks and those Marines who had
made it home. General Shepherd
called it hallowed ground and told
the distinguished assemblage, which
included a hastily cleaned-up honor
guard of brigade troops: “you have
avenged the loss of our comrades
who were overcome by a numerically
superior force three days after Pearl
Harbor. Under our flag this island
again stands ready to fulfill its destiny
as an American fortress in the
Pacific.”</p>

<p>Many of the Marines standing at
attention, watching the historic
ceremony, could only thank God that
they were still alive. At the end of
this ceremony, engineers moved onto
the airfield to clear away debris and
fill the many shell and bomb holes.</p>

<p>Only six hours after the first bulldozer
clanked onto the runways, a Navy
torpedo bomber made an emergency
landing. Soon the light artillery spotting
planes were regularly flying
from them.</p>

<p>The capture of Orote Peninsula
had cost the brigade 115 men killed,
721 wounded, and 38 missing in action.
The enemy toll of counted dead
was 1,633. It was obvious that on
Orote as at Fonte, there were many
Japanese still unaccounted for and
presumably ready still to fight to prevent
the island’s capture.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak p0">War Dogs on Guam</h3>

<p class="drop-cap tancap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> the late summer of 1942, the Marine Corps
decided to experiment with the use of dogs in war,
which may have been a new departure for the Corps,
but not a new idea in warfare. Since ancient times, dogs
have served fighting men in various ways. The Romans,
for instance, used heavy mastiffs with armored collars to
attack the legs of their enemies, thus forcing them to lower
their shields.</p>

<div id="ip_27b" class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
  <img src="images/i_027.jpg" width="300" height="273" alt="" /></div>

<p>On Guam, First Lieutenant William R. Putney commanded
the 1st Dog Platoon and was the veterinarian for
all war dogs on Guam. First Lieutenant William T. Taylor
commanded the 2d Platoon. Both landed on the Asan-Adelup
beach on Guam, while the 1st Platoon under Gunnery
Sergeant L.&nbsp;C. Christmore landed with the 1st Provisional
Brigade at Agat.</p>

<p>Sixty dogs, 90 handlers, 10 NCO assistants, two war dog
corpsmen, and three kennelmen were distributed among
the regimental and division headquarters of the 3d Marine
Division. Lieutenant Putney commanded the 36 handlers
and 24 dogs out of division headquarters. Overall,
some 350 war dogs served in the Guam operation.</p>

<p>Handlers were trained dog specialists and skilled scouts
as well. Man and dog searched out the enemy, awaited his
coming, and caught him by surprise around the Marine
perimeter or while on patrol. In addition, they found
snipers, routed stragglers, searched out caves and pillboxes,
ran messages, and protected the Marines’ foxholes as
they would private homes. The dogs ate, slept, walked, and
otherwise lived with their masters.</p>

<p>The presence of dogs on the line could promise the Marines
there a night’s sleep, for they alerted their handlers
when the enemy came near.</p>

<p>Early on in the Guam operations, some dogs were
wounded or killed by machine gun and rifle fire, and incoming
mortars were as devastating to the dogs as they
were to the Marines. When the dogs were wounded, the
Marines made a point of getting them to the rear, to the
veterinarian, as quickly as possible. In the liberation of
Guam, 20 dogs were wounded and 25 killed.</p>

<p>From the end of the campaign to the end of the war in
the Pacific, Guam served as a staging area for war dogs,
of which 465 served in combat operations. Of the Marine
Corps war dogs, 85 percent were Doberman Pinschers, and
the rest mainly German Shepherds.</p>

<p>At the end of the Pacific War, the Marine Corps had 510
war dogs. Of this number, 491 were deprogrammed, a
process that could take a year, and returned to their owners,
given to their handlers, or returned to the Army, which
had provided 41 to the Corps. Only four dogs could not
be returned to their masters because, even after extensive
retraining, they proved “incorrigible” and were considered
to be unsafe for civilian life.

<p>With the breakthrough at Fonte
and failure of Takashina’s mass counterattack,
the American positions
could be consolidated. The 3d and
21st Marines squared away their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
holds on heights and the 9th Marines
(July 27&ndash;29) pushed its final way up
to Mount Alutom and Mount
Chachao.</p>

<p>The most serious resistance to occupying
the Mount Alutom-Mount
Chachao massif and securing the
Force Beachhead Line (FBHL) across
the hills was a surprisingly strong
point at the base of Mount Chachao.
Major Donald B. Hubbard, commanding
the 3d Battalion, 9th Marines
(replacing Lieutenant Colonel
Asmuth, wounded on W-Day),
called down artillery, and, after the
barrage, his Marines attacked with
grenades and bayonets. They destroyed
everything that stood in their
path. When that fight was over,
Major Hubbard’s battalion counted
135 Japanese dead. As the assault
force pushed up these commanding
slopes, the Marines could spot men
of Company A of the 305th Infantry
atop Mount Tenjo to the west.
Lieutenant Colonel Carey A. Randall’s
1st Battalion, 9th Marines, then
moved up and made contact with the
Army troops. Originally, Mount
Tenjo had been in the 3d Division
zone, but General Bruce had wanted
to get his men on the high ground
so they could push ahead along the
heights and not get trapped in the ravines.
He also wanted to prevent the
piecemeal commitment of his division
and to preserve its integrity.</p>

<p>Conservative estimates put the
Japanese dead as a result of the counterattack
at 3,200 men. The loss of
Takashina’s infantry officers, including
General Shigematsu, who had
commanded the <i>48th Independent
Mixed Brigade</i>, was held to be as high
as 96 percent. Takashina himself fell
to the fire from a machine gun on an
American tank as he was urging survivors
out of the Fonte position and
on to the north to fight again. With
Takashina’s death, tactical command
of all Japanese forces remaining on
Guam was assumed by General Obata.
He had only a few senior officers
remaining to rally the surviving
defenders and organize cohesive units
from the shattered remnants of the
battalions that had fought to hold the
heights above the Asan-Adelup
beaches.</p>

<p>All through the night of 28 July,
Japanese troops trudged along the
paths that led from Fonte to Ordot,
finding their way at times by the light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
of American flares. At Ordot, two
traffic control points guided men
toward Barrigada, where three composite
infantry companies were forming,
or toward Finegayan, where a
force of five composite companies
was to man blocking positions. As he
fully expected the Americans to conduct
an aggressive pursuit on the
29th, General Obata ordered Lieutenant
Colonel Takeda to organize a
delaying force that would hold back
the Marines until the withdrawal
could be effected.</p>

<p>Contrary to the Japanese commander’s
expectations, General
Geiger had decided to rest his battle-weary
troops before launching a full-scale
attack to the north. The substance
of his orders to the 3d and
77th Divisions on 29 July was to
eliminate the last vestiges of Japanese
resistance within the FBHL, organize
a line of defense, and patrol in
strength to the front. With capture of
the beachhead line and its critical
high ground and the annihilation of
great numbers of Japanese, the turning
point of the Guam campaign had
been reached.</p>

<p>Yet, few Japanese had surrendered
and those captured were usually
dazed, wounded, or otherwise unable
to resist. Almost all of the enemy
died fighting, even when their
lives were lost without sense or purpose.
Still, a substantial number of
troops from the <i>29th Division</i> were
still not accounted for.</p>

<p>General Geiger’s intelligence sections
could only list about one quarter
of the estimated soldier-sailor
strength that had been on the island,
and he needed to make certain that
his rear was secure from attack before
heading north after the enemy.
Captured Japanese documents and
prisoners of war, and sightings from
aircraft, all indicated to Geiger that
the Japanese had withdrawn to the
north to better roads, denser and
more concealing jungle, and commanding
terrain for strongpoints.</p>

<p>To ensure that his rear area was
not threatened, General Geiger had
the 77th Division detail patrols to
scour the southern half of Guam,
repeating and intensifying the
searches the brigade had made.
These soldiers, as the Marines before
them, found Guamanians everywhere,
some in camps established by
the Japanese, others on their farms
and ranches. The natives, some surprised
to see Americans so soon after
the landings, reported the
presence of only small bands of
Japanese and often only single soldiers.
It became increasingly evident
that the combat units that remained
were in the north, not the south. The
best estimates of their strength
ranged around a figure of 6,000 men.</p>

  <div class="captionl"><i>Marines of the 1st Provisional Brigade hurl hand grenades at enemy positions on

<p>Obata had expected a hasty pursuit,
and set up strong rear guards to
give time for his retreating forces to
organize. Victory was no longer even
a hope, but the Japanese could still
extract a painful cost. General Geiger,
who had a little time now, could give
his troops a rest and move into attack
positions across the width of the
island. Strong and frequent patrols
were sent out to find routes cross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>

strength and dispositions.</p>

<div class="captionl">
<p><i>Marines bypass two smoldering Japanese light tanks, knocked out of action by

<p>Obata organized delaying defenses
to include the southwest slopes of
Mount Barrigada, midway across the
island from Tumon Bay, and the little
town of Barrigada itself, barely 20
houses. On all approaches to his final
defensive positions near Mount
Santa Rosa, in the northwest corner
of the island, he organized roadblocks
at trail and road junctions,
principally at Finegayan and Yigo,
and concealed troops in the jungle to
interdict the roads which were the
only practical approach routes to the
northern end of the island. The
Japanese commander felt sorely besieged,
and as his notes later revealed:
“the enemy air force seeking our units
during daylight hours in the forest,
bombed and strafed even a single
soldier.” Perhaps even more damaging
than the air attacks were artillery
and naval gunfire bombardments
brought down on men, guns,
trenches, anything, by the Navy, Marines,
and Army spotter planes which
were constantly overhead.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Attack_North" id="The_Attack_North"></a><i>The Attack North</i></h2>

<p>III Corps’s Geiger knew Obata’s
probable route of retreat and drew up
a succession of objectives across the
island which would incrementally
seize all potential enemy strongpoints.
Jump-off for the drive north
was 0630 31 July with the 3d Marine
Division on the left and the 77th Infantry
Division on the right, dividing
the island down the middle. The Marine
zone would include the island
capital of Agana, the Japanese airfield
at Tiyan, Finegayan, and the
shores of Tumon Bay. The 77th
would have Mount Barrigada, Yigo,
and Mount Santa Rosa in its zone.
The 1st Marine Brigade relieved the
77th Division of the defense of the
southern portion of the FBHL and
would continue to patrol the
southern half of Guam. As the Corps
attack moved northward and the island
widened, the brigade would
eventually take part in the drive to
the extreme north coast of the island.</p>

<p>The 3d Division reached Ordot in
the center of its zone where Obata
had directed some of his survivors.
The 3d Battalion, 21st Marines, ran
into them and one of their pillboxes,
which the Marines thoroughly gutted.
The Americans also accounted
for 15 infantrymen and two light
tanks which were the targets of M-1s
and bazookas.</p>

<p>The honor of liberating Agana fell
to the 3d Battalion, 3d Marines. The
riflemen entered the town’s ruins
treading carefully, sizing up the stark,
dusty building walls for snipers. A
few enemy riflemen emerged from
behind concrete outcroppings then
dropped back into eternity. The
Japanese guards were stragglers, the
wounded, or a few foolish enough to
stay. In one house, a Marine opened
a closet to reveal a Japanese officer,
sword in hand. The Marine slammed
the door, riddled it with an automatic
rifle, and didn’t bother to look
again. The once-beautiful old Plaza
de Espana was in American hands 15
minutes after the town was entered.
By noon it was secured.</p>

<p>The 1st and 2d Battalions, 3d Marines,
moved along to the critical
Agana-Pago Road. At 1350 the 21st
Marines was right up there with
them after the few engagements with
pillboxes, snipers, and tanks. By
1510, Colonel Craig’s 9th Marines on
the division’s right was partially
across the road and seized the remaining
portion of that highway in
its sector on the next day. Hard-surfaced,
with two lanes across the
midriff of the island, the Agana-Pago
Road would prove critical in winning
the battle of Guam.</p>

<p>Leaving Agana and its historic rescue
of the capital, the 3d Battalion,
3d Marines, under Major Royal R.
Bastian, Jr., who had taken command
when Lieutenant Colonel
Houser was wounded on 22 July,
moved on with relative ease. Before
dusk the battalion had seized 1,400
yards of other critical roads and trails
which led to strategic and defended
strongpoints of Finegayan and Barrigada.</p>

<p>General Turnage got well within
striking distance of the Tiyan airfield
and the little town of San Antonio,
on the 31st, but the next day, 1 August,
his advance was seriously
slowed by mines. It took the cool skill
and slow and steady hands of the
bomb disposal specialists of the 25th
Naval Construction Battalion and the
19th Marines’ engineers to reduce
those obstacles.</p>

<p>Students of the battle and those
who were there consider the taking
of the cross-island Agana-Pago Road
as a major factor in guaranteeing the
success of the drive northward. Its
capture solved a host of logistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
problems, for the 77th particularly.
The Army division, for example, had
no roads heading north initially in its
zone of advance and needed such a
road over which it could supply its
troops as they came down out of the
hills and cut their way through the
jungle. Frontline troops in the Army
zone were soon running low on supplies,
especially water. General Bruce
promised his people a hot breakfast
as soon as they and the Marines
could give him the road. Trucks were
soon thick on the road even while
SeaBees and engineers were enlarging
and repairing it.</p>

<p><i>Troops of the 3d Battalion, 3d Marines, enter the wreckage of Agana in the trace

<p>The 77th had moved out on schedule
just after daylight on 31 July, with
the 307th Infantry in the advance,
followed by the 305th. As was the situation
facing the 3d Division, enemy
resistance to the Army advance was
negligible. Within two hours, both
Army regiments had secured the
cross-island road in their zones. The
307th rescued 2,000 Guamanians in
the detention camp at Asinan. Unopposed,
the 77th by noon of 1 August
was across the Pago River. Residents
of the area said the Japanese had left
in a hurry for Barrigada, a destination
where III Corps intelligence already
anticipated the enemy would
hold up. The jungle-covered mountain
there, 674 feet high, dominated
the area.</p>

<p>General Bruce assigned the capture
of Barrigada to the 307th. It was to
maintain contact with the 3d Marine
Division on the left and push
through the town, then continue
about a mile to seize Mount Barrigada.
The 305th to the right of the
307th would attack in the same direction
east of the town and Barrigada
mountain and protect to the coast.
The town was in a clearing fully
swept with defensive machine gun
fire. In the same clearing was a
much-desired well. Its capture meant
the world to the parched troops.</p>

<p>At 0630, 2 August General Bruce
dispatched a dozen tanks of the 706th
Tank Battalion on a reconnaissance.
As the “recon” armor turned into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
Barrigada town, the enemy opened up
with a torrent of fire. The determined
Japanese fiercely resisted the 307th
when it reached the town and were
equally determined to stop the 305th
on the right as that regiment’s assault
companies tried to outflank the town.
Repeated tank attacks and heavy artillery
support netted only a few
yards at a time, but the soldiers kept
advancing and by 4 August, the 77th
Division held the town, or what was
left of it, its precious well, and the
crest of the mountain.</p>

<p>Captured documents and interviews
with prisoners again left little
doubt that the 77th Division’s major
obstacle would be rugged, heavily
crevassed, and jungled Mount Santa
Rosa. It is six and a half miles northeast
of Barrigada and a short distance
from the ocean on the east coast.</p>

<p>First to be addressed on the way
were well-armed outposts like
Finegayan and Yigo. Each promised
casualties, blood, and delay. General
Geiger employed the 77th to reduce
Yigo and take Santa Rosa, and left
the capture of Finegayan and the rest
of northern Guam principally to the
3d Marine Division. He brought up
General Shepherd’s brigade to assist
in the final drive. To protect the Force
Beachhead Line, care for the Guamanians,
and hunt down enemy stragglers
in the south, General Geiger
tasked the 1st Battalion, 22d Marines;
the 7th Antiaircraft Artillery
Battalion; and the 9th Defense Battalion,
all under Lieutenant Colonel
Archie E. O’Neil, who commanded
the 9th.</p>

<p>Before moving on, the brigade had
aggressively sought out Japanese
holdouts, brought the fearful
Guamanians into friendly compounds,
and provided security for
those who chose to remain in their
own homes and again work their
own ranches. As late as 2 August, 4th
Marines’ patrols approaching Talofofo
Bay on the southeast coast, came
across some 2,000 natives, still apprehensive
of the Japanese, who were
directed to a compound which
promised safety and at least minimum
comforts. The Guamanian people
in their own residential and farm
areas could, however, still readily call
upon the civil affairs sections for
food, protection, medicine, and
shelter. Such civil care was integral to
the American occupation and was
controlled by Marine General Larsen,
who would head the garrison force
as soon as the island was again under
the American flag.</p>

<p>During the night of 2&ndash;3 August,
the 12th Marines delivered 777
rounds of harassing and interdictory
fire on the roads and trails the division
would encounter around
Finegayan. At 0700 on 3 August, the
3d and 9th Marines moved in assault
well past the Tinyan airfield. Then,
about 0910 the 9th encountered a
block at the cross roads approaching
Finegayan village. The situation and
terrain favored the Japanese with excellent
fields of fire. After the
Japanese position was finally overrun
with tanks, Lieutenant Colonel
Carey Randall, commanding 1st Battalion,
9th Marines, said that these
defenses were the toughest he had
faced on Guam.</p>

<p>That contest for Finegayan was the
last major battle for the 3d Division
on Guam. The Japanese made it
something to remember. A 3d Division<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
armored reconnaissance patrol
headed for Ritidian Point on the
northernmost point of the island ran
into Japanese defenses located on the
Finegayan trails bristling with antitank
weapons and artillery pointed
in the direction of the patrol. The
Americans were surprised and
bruised, did the Japanese some harm,
but sensibly cancelled the mission.</p>

<div class="captionl">
<p><i>The Catholic cemetery of Anigua became the home of approximately 7,000 Guamanians

<p>The Japanese were plenty feisty at
Finegayan, and in a telling thrust dispatched
two medium tanks which
skirted the crossroads of the 9th Marines
at Junction 177 and went up the
Finegayan-Mount Santa Rosa Road.
Impervious to Marine fire, the tanks
shot up the area and got away.
Another tank force of undetermined
size then rumbled down under cover
of a mortar barrage and it looked like
the beginning of a counterattack. Artillery
stilled that Japanese effort.
The enemy tanks were driven off but
survived to reappear again another
day.</p>

<p>It was in one of those typical sudden
enemy attacks around Finegayan
that Private First Class Frank P. Witek,
with automatic rifle and
grenades, raced ahead of his own
tanks to destroy an eight-man
Japanese position which was holding
back elements of his 1st Battalion,
9th Marines. He succeeded, but was
killed. He was posthumously awarded
the Medal of Honor.</p>

<p>On 4 August, the new frontlines
and scheme of maneuver were being
set up to keep pressure on General
Obata and his holdouts, and make
a place for General Shepherd and his
brigade. During the afternoon, the
brigade reached its northern assembly
area and General Shepherd set up
his CP near San Antonio. In the final
advance north, the brigade would
be on the left with its inland flank
within a mile of the western beaches.
The 3d Division would be in the
center deploying its units on a three-regiment
front which would swerve
to the east to take in the whole northern
end of the island and as well support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
the 77th Division.</p>

<p>The Japanese now faced an overwhelming
number of attack forces.
And there would be plenty of help
from the sea and from the air. General
Bruce’s soldiers made the principal
corps drive to destroy the remaining
Japanese and attacked Mount Santa
Rosa. Priority of fires of corps artillery,
air support, and ships’ gunfire
was now given to the Army. These
new arrangements were to take effect
on 7 August.</p>

<p>Making new strides to end the
campaign, the 3d and 21st Marines
progressed handily but the 9th Marines
kept running into dense jungle
that was such a tangled mess that
tanks passed each other 15 feet apart
without knowing the other was
there. The division accelerated its advance
in battalion columns. On 6 August,
it had progressed 5,000 yards
along the road to Ritidian Point, the
end of the island and the end of the
battle for Guam. As that evening fell,
the 3d Division was in visual contact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
with the 77th Infantry Division,
wherever the all-encompassing jungle
allowed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, heavy Seventh Air
Force bombing as well as artillery
and naval shelling of enemy areas
had been going on for days. Night
fighters were now assigned to support
the advance, so even darkness
afforded the Japanese no protection.
By that same 6 August, the defense
line that General Obata had set
across Guam had been shattered and
overrun. Only isolated pockets now
existed before Santa Rosa.</p>

<p>No American commander could
say on 7 August when the fight for
Guam would be over. General Bruce
in his attack first to Yigo and then
Santa Rosa would have a relatively
fresh regiment, the 306th, which had
come up from the south where it had
patrolled with the brigade. It was in
contact with the 9th Marines on the
division boundary. Colonel Douglas
C. McNair, 77th Division chief of
staff, was there, too, seeking a site for
a division CP and was killed by a
sniper. Colonel McNair’s father,
Lieutenant General Leslie J. McNair,
was killed in France 12 days earlier
during an American bombing raid.</p>

<p>The attack on Mount Santa Rosa
began at noon, 7 August. Behind the
rumble of artillery and rattle of
tanks, answered in kind by the enemy,
the 77th took Yigo, the door to
Santa Rosa, and continued General
Bruce’s wheeling maneuver. Bulldozers
blazed trails, and tanks and infantry
overran machine gun
positions. The 77th was dug into positions
on the night of 7&ndash;8 August
ready for the final attack on the
mountain. The expected big Japanese
counterattack still did not come. The
rapid advance of the Americans accompanied
by heavy artillery support
likely forestalled that forelorn
hope.</p>

<p>Two regiments, the 305th and
307th, proceeded rapidly on 8 August.
By 1240, the northern half of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
Mount Santa Rosa was in American
hands, and the troops moved to secure
the rest of the mountain. By
1440 the Army had reached the cliffs
by the sea and could look right down
to the ocean. The 306th infantry had
also completed an enveloping move
to take the northern slopes of Mount
Santa Rosa.</p>

<p>Only 600 enemy bodies were
found after the two-day fight for
Yigo and Santa Rosa. Yet, estimates
of the enemy personnel at Santa Rosa
had been as high as 5,000. So this
meant that enemy troops in significant
number now infested the jungled
terrain everywhere on Guam. Worse,
some enemy tanks were also unaccounted
for. Enemy survivors of the
Mount Santa Rosa battle kept drifting
into the 9th Marines lines on the
Army flank, slowing the regiment’s
advance. Sharp-eyed Marines noted
more than a smattering of enemy
movement near a particular hill in
the Army zone. This was believed to
be the command post area of General
Obata.</p>

<p>The 3d Marines on the left of the
division’s zone had progressed with
the same occasional enemy opposition.
A 19-man roadblock held up
the Marines, but was taken out
quickly. Searching a corridor between
the 3d and the 9th Marines,
the 21st Marines came upon the bodies
of 30 Guamanians near Chaguian.
They had been beheaded.</p>

<p>The brigade had it a little easier on
the far west, for it found negligible
resistance as it advanced along fairly
good trails. On 8 August, a patrol
of the 22d Marines reached Ritidian
Point, the northernmost point of the
island. Moving along a twisting cliff
trail to the beach, the Marines encountered
less-than-aggressive
Japanese defenses which they quickly
overcame. General Shepherd’s 1st
Provisional Marine Brigade had the
distinction of being first to reach both
the southernmost point of the island
in the early days of the campaign and
the northernmost section of Guam at
Ritidian Point at this time.</p>

<p>General Shepherd’s Marines began
vigorously patrolling the area they
occupied, but found few Japanese.
As a result, General Geiger reduced
the amount of naval gunfire placed
on the area, while Saipan-based
Seventh Air Force P-47’s made their
last bombing and strafing runs on
Ritidian Point. The 22d Marines was
down below the cliffs at Ritidian,
scouring along the beaches where
there are many caves. The 4th Marines
was on the north coast at Mengagan
Point and tied by patrols to the
22d Marines. At 1800, 9 August,
General Shepherd declared organized
resistance had ceased in his zone.</p>

<p>It was not so easy for the 3d Marines.
On the night of 8&ndash;9 August
near Tarague, the regiment was hit
by a last-resort Japanese mortar and
tank attack. Marine antitank
grenades and bazooka rockets were
wet and ineffective and the Japanese
blazed away with impunity and then
ducked back into the woods. Amazingly,
when Major William A. Culpepper,
commanding the 2d
Battalion (Lieutenant Colonel de
Zayas had been killed on 26 July),
counted heads, he found that he had
suffered not a single casualty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span></p>

<p>Patrols of the 9th Marines advanced
to Pati Point, the northeast
projection of the island. Intelligence
sources then reported to Colonel
Craig that a mass of Japanese (maybe
2,000) troops were holed up at
Savana Grand, a wild tract of jungle,
coconut trees, and high grasses
near the coast. Colonel Craig did not
want to risk casualties so close to the
end of the campaign, so the artillery
supporting the 9th Marines fired a total
of 2,280 rounds. The few Japanese
survivors were either killed or became
prisoners. The final American
positions formed along the coast. By
nightfall of 8 August, Colonel Craig’s
Marines could wave to the soldiers of
the 306th patrolling to their south.</p>

<p>General Geiger was not ready to
declare Guam secure until a pocket
of tanks still existing in the 3d Division
zone was wiped out. That had
to be done by the 10th, for that was
the day Admiral Nimitz was scheduled
to arrive on a visit. There were
tanks indeed and the task of finding
and eliminating them was given to
Major Culpepper’s 2d Battalion, 3d
Marines. Advancing at 0730, the battalion
and a platoon of American
Sherman tanks soon found two enemy
mediums firing, only 400 yards
up the trail the Marines were following.
The Shermans left their counterparts
black and burning. Seven more
enemy mediums were abandoned. A
Japanese infantry platoon withdrew
to the coastal cliffs and was killed
there.</p>

<p>On that day, 10 August, at 1131
as he learned that the last Japanese
tanks still in action had been destroyed,
General Geiger declared all
organized resistance on Guam had
ended. It was a great day for the
Guamanians. The island was theirs
again.</p>

<p>It was also the next to the last day
for General Obata. His Mount
Mataguac position was strongly
defended, so much so that when the
306th had tried to force it earlier it
failed. On the morning of 11 August
1944, when the general knew his
headquarters had been discovered
and that his enemy was coming for
him, Obata signalled to his emperor:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>... We are continuing a
desperate battle. We have only
our bare hands to fight with.
The holding of Guam has become
hopeless. Our souls will
defend the island to the very
end. I am overwhelmed with
sorrow for the families of the
many officers and men. I pray
for the prosperity of the
Empire.</p></blockquote>

<p>The 306th made the last assault
supported by tanks and demolition
squads. The enemy defenders killed
seven Americans and wounded 17
before they went down to defeat, buried
in the rubble of blown caves and
emplacements. General Obata took
his own life or was killed sometime
during those last hours of the battle
of Guam.</p>

  <div class="captionl"><i>Prisoners of war in the Guam stockade stand with bowed heads as they are read the August 1945 surrender announcement.</i></div></div>

<p>Major General Henry L. Larsen assumed
command of the Guam Island
Command at 1200, 15 August. Under
him, and largely with the forces
of the 3d Marine Division, the mopping
up continued.</p>

<p>Part of Japan’s terrible cost on
Guam was the 10,971 bodies already
counted. Yet there were some 10,000
Japanese still on the island. At first
some of these men fought and staged
ambushes, and a few sniped at the
Americans, but soon the remaining
Japanese sought only one thing&mdash;food!
Most of the others fled when
encountered. The Japanese now had
no central command. They starved,
died of dysentery, became too weak
to flee, and then blew themselves up
with the one precious grenade which
they saved to take their own lives.
Aggressive American patrols were
soon killing or capturing 80 Japanese
soldiers and sailors a day. A daring
few stole into Marine food storage
areas at night. One soldier scribbled:
“All around me are enemy only. It
takes a brave man indeed to go in
search of food.”</p>

<p>In addition to the battlefield
casualties, more than 8,500 Japanese
were killed or captured on Guam between
August 1944 and the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
the war in August 1945.</p>

<p>In the 21 days of the Guam campaign
ending 10 August, Marine
units of the III Amphibious Corps
reported 1,190 men killed in action,
377 dead of wounds, and 5,308
wounded. The 77th Division’s casualties
were 177 soldiers killed and 662
wounded. The Army and the Marines
were a closely knit team in the
recapture of Guam. It is reputed that
General Holland Smith was the first
to refer to General Bruce’s troops as
the “77th Marines.” Major Aplington,
a battalion commander in the 3d Marines,
commented on the soldiers:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In their fatigues so different
from our herringbone utilities
and their olive drab ponchos
(ours were camouflaged) so
different from us ... there was
no doubt in our minds that the
77th were good people to have
alongside in a fight and as a
result we referred to them as
“The 77th Marine Division.”</p></blockquote>

<p>On the same busy day, 10 August,
only hours after Major Culpepper’s
battalion had knocked out the last of
the Japanese tanks, the <i>Indianapolis</i>
(CA 35) steamed into Apra Harbor
with Marine Corps Commandant
Lieutenant General Alexander A.
Vandegrift on board, accompanying
Admiral Nimitz. On 15 August, Admiral
Nimitz directed that his forward
CinCPac-CinCPOA headquarters
be established on Guam, and
from here, he directed the rest of the
Pacific War. Soon after, from airfields
on Guam, as well as those on
Tinian, B-29s were blasting the
Japanese home islands. Hard fighting
was yet to be experienced by Marine
divisions on Peleliu, Iwo Jima,
and Okinawa. But whether they
knew it or not, the end of the war
was less than a year away.</p>

<p class="drop-cap tancap"><span class="smcap1">Private</span> First Class Frank Peter
Witek’s Medal of Honor citation
reads as follows: “For conspicuous
gallantry and intrepidity at
the risk of his life above and beyond
the call of duty while serving with the
1st Battalion, 9th Marines, 3d Marine
Division, during the Battle of
Finegayan at Guam, Marianas Islands,
on 3 August 1944. When his rifle platoon
was halted by heavy surprise fire
from well camouflaged enemy positions,
Private First Class Witek daringly
remained standing to fire a full
magazine from his [Browning] automatic
[rifle] at point-blank range into
a depression housing Japanese troops,
killing eight of the enemy and enabling
the greater part of his platoon to take
cover. During his platoon’s withdrawal
for consolidation of lines, he remained
to safeguard a severely
wounded comrade, courageously
returning the enemy’s fire until the arrival
of stretcher bearers, and then
covering the evacuation by sustained
fire as he moved backward toward his
own lines. With his platoon again
pinned down by a hostile machine
gun, Private First Class Witek, on his
initiative, moved forward boldly to the
reinforcing tanks, and infantry, alternately
throwing hand grenades and firing
as he advanced to within 5 to 10
yards of the enemy position, and destroying
the hostile machine-gun emplacement
and an additional eight
Japanese before he himself was struck
down by an enemy rifleman. His valiant
and inspiring action effectively
reduced the enemy’s firepower, thereby
enabling his platoon to attain its objective,
and reflects the highest credit
upon Private First Class Witek and the
United States naval service. He gallantly
gave his life for his country.”

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
